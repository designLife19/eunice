              <p>
                One of biggest challenges was how to create Dashboard UX / UI design that would satisfy users of all ages.
                <br /><br />
                The existing some older users wanted to see all the data and information in the dashboard. For example.
                Update Notices, view all Bid lists and to-do List, and Work in Progress List on the same page.
                Also all list have included task, description, created date, progress history as well.
                They wanted to keep the UX / UI design because it was very familiar with it.
                <br /><br />
                On the other hand, Younger users wanted to customize their own personal dashboard simply and clearly so that
                they could see what exactly they wanted.

                And our team agree with them. Because We reallized that the original dashboard is so complex to find the
                right data at once.

            <!-- solving-->
            <div class="csBody">
              <div class="body_header">Solving</div>
              <p>
                Our team decided to have two different versions of dashboard. One is to keep the existing version.
                The other one is individual dashboard so that user can choose the dashboard by themselves.
                <br /><br />
                To built new Individual dashboard UX/ UI, I first started serching the web to get better ideas and had to focus on
                how to display the status of each task simply and clearly.
                Since I realized that a dashboard with all the information is a big part of the interaction,
                displaying the details for each item would clutter the screen.
                After trying different views, meeting the team, sharing ideas and getting advice, I developed card view dashboard
                mockups and prototypes.
                The card acts as a container of clickable information. It serves as a bite-sized preview to make it easier
                for users to find what they're looking for.
                <br /><br />
                Here are the workflows.
              </p>
            <!-- mockup 01-->
              <div class="cs_description">
                <p class="title">Mock-up 01. Individual Card View with progress bar</p>
                <p>
                  I have created card view dashboard mock-up which displays only the projects selected by user.
                  I was trying to indicate the status of each bid by progress bar for helping user to understand where they are,
                  what the next step is.
                  <br /><br />
                  However, our developer team did not agree with to using progress bar to display the status all of each bids.
                  This is because technical issues may arise if users create a lot of bidding projects.
                  We also received feedback that if it is happened, the card dashboard will be to complicate again.
                  After that, I spent a lot of time with the developers to avoid discord between design and development
                  is to communicate early and often.

                <p>
                  After meeting with developer team, I had to think other way to make it simple and clear to show each status / stage instead of
                  progress bar. Then I shared the idea using simple colours. Each card displays their own status with a colour icon
                  on the top left corner and displays the project title and basic information.
                  It also displays the last link the user was on to help them navigate directly to the page
                  before they signed out. Also added a navigation bar icon that displays a list of other steps and links for
                  easy navigation.

                All cards are shown by default. But the user can display the card view with the selected stage.

                And serchbox allows user to easily browse the list and select the checkboxes to display on their own dashboard.
                Developer team agree with the search bar on the list.

                I have created a bid menu button on each card to lead users to easily and simply visit different pages of the bid.
                It was created to avoid clicking through many pages to find one page.
                The menu icon helps the user to avoid confusion while finding relevant pages for each bid they want.
