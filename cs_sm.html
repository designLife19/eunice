			SavingMate is that financial budgeting app that helps users plan and set short-term financial goals and
			allows users to easily set a goal and prioritize goals, adjust them as circumstances change, and
			receive personalized recommendations for saving. Users can track progress through visual aids, celebrate small victories,
			and categorize goals by priority by providing a simple and easy-to-use mobile platform.
			<br /><br />
			This is an independent student project completed while in the UX Bootcamp program at the Brain Station.
			And I created this entire app from the scratch to the end as a UX/UI designer. It took 10 weeks to be completed.

                Many young adults in Canada struggle to understand the importance of managing a budget and lack the skills and
                knowledge necessary to effectively budget, spend, and save their money. This can lead to financial difficulties
                such as debt, inability to reach financial goals, and insufficient savings for emergencies and future expenses.

              <p>
                The main challenge of this project was to design an app that could assist users in setting and
                achieving short-term financial goals while also providing the motivation to stay on track.
                <br />
                Through plenty of research, user interviews, persona, and user testing, I understood the goals, motivations,
                and pain points of the users within their services as well as resolved any problems by designing a better solution for them.
                </p>
                Therefore, I assumed that if the app calculates the amounts and displays in visualization
                how much a user needs to save money per day, week, or month, it can help them to motivate
                to save money to achieve the goal user has set.
                <span>There are some main points I should focus on;</span>
                <ul>
                  <li>Simplifying the process of setting goals</li>
                  <li>Making it easy to adjust goals and priorities</li>
                  <li>Providing clear and intuitive visualizations to track progress towards goals</li>
                  <li>Streamlining the progress report screen to make it easy to understand progress at a glance</li>
                  <li>Offering encouraging feedback or celebrating small victories to help users stay motivated and achieve their goals.  </li>
                </ul>

                Developed a user-friendly interface that allows users to set their goals quickly and easily.
                The interface should be visually appealing and simple to navigate, with clear instructions and prompts to guide users through each step.
                And Users should also be able to customize their goals' frequency, duration, and difficulty based on their individual needs and preferences.

              <p>
                And through this project, here are some key learnings.
                <br />
                01.Conducting user research, including interviews and creating personas, helped me understand my target users' needs, pain points, and motivations. <br />
                02.Creating low to high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes, and testing them with users, helped me identify usability issues, iterate on designs,
                and refine the user experience. <br />
                03.I learned that one of the main benefits of creating a UI library is ensuring consistency across different application parts.
                And also, measuring redlines is a crucial part of ensuring that my designs are pixel-perfect and that developers can implement them accurately.
